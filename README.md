# Croft
**Welcome to Croft, the Foundation WordPress starter theme.**

Croft is built with search-engine optimization (SEO) in mind by utilizing the most current HTML5 conventions and [Schema.org](http://schema.org) microdata.
Croft combines ZURB's Foundation, the most advanced responsive front-end framework in the world, and Hybrid Core, the developer friendly theme framework created by one of the best WordPress developers around, Justin Tadlock.

Croft isn't mean't to be used as is, it's mean't to used to create your next masterpiece!

Croft requires a minimum of WordPress 4.5.

## What comes with Croft?
Croft comes with all of the features you love from Foundation for Sites, along with minimal styling to cover all WordPress core components. The theme comes setup to be used with Foundations Sass mixins (default and my preferred method) or optionally with classes.

## What tools do I need to use Croft?
Croft is built with **Bower** and **Gulp** usage in mind and is the recommended way to use this theme.
However theme assets should compile just fine using other tools.

## Getting Started With Croft

### Install node.js.
- Using the command line, navigate to your theme directory
- Run `npm install` to install Gulp plugins and Bower packages and copy Hybrid Core to `/inc/hybrid-core/`.
- Run `gulp` to confirm everything is working

#### gulp
